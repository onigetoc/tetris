## About the Project

This Tetris clone was developed as an experimental project to explore AI-assisted game development. Created with the help of Claude Sonnet (an AI language model) over approximately 60 prompts and 4-5 hours of work, it offers a functional yet imperfect implementation of the classic game.

The game features:
- Classic Tetris gameplay
- Background music and sound effects
- Score tracking
- Game over and replay functionality

While playable and enjoyable, the game currently has only one difficulty level and some timing issues remain unresolved.

## Development Challenges

One of the main challenges encountered during development was the timing of the sound effect when Tetriminos touch the bottom of the play area. Due to the one-second cycle of the piece descent, there's a slight delay in playing the sound when no keyboard input is made. This issue remains unresolved without significant code refactoring.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement include:
- Fixing the sound timing issue
- Adding multiple difficulty levels
- Implementing a high score system
- Enhancing visual effects and animations
