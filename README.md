Tetris game made with AI Claude 3.5 sonnet

Tetris Game Project
===================

Overview
--------

This project is a Tetris game implementation using HTML, JavaScript, and the Phaser 3 game framework. It was developed with the assistance of Claude Sonnet, an AI language model, over approximately 60 prompts and 4-5 hours of work.

Features
--------

*   Classic Tetris gameplay
*   Background music and sound effects
*   Score tracking
*   Game over and replay functionality
*   Single difficulty level

Development Process
-------------------

The development of this game was an experimental project, aimed at exploring the capabilities of AI-assisted game development. It proved to be more complex than initially anticipated, resulting in a functional but not perfect implementation.

### Challenges

One of the main challenges encountered was the timing of the sound effect when Tetriminos touch the bottom of the play area. Due to the one-second cycle of the piece descent, there's a slight delay in playing the sound when no keyboard input is made. This issue remains unresolved without significant code refactoring, which would have required a substantial number of additional tokens in the AI conversation.

Project Satisfaction
--------------------

While the overall project is satisfactory and playable, it's important to note that it's far from perfect. There's only one difficulty level, and some timing issues persist. However, as an experimental project, it provided valuable insights into game development processes and the potential of AI assistance in coding tasks.

Conclusion
----------

This Tetris project was an enjoyable and educational experience. It served its purpose as a pure experimentation in AI-assisted game development. While not without its flaws, it demonstrates the potential of using AI models like Claude Sonnet in creative coding projects.

Future Improvements
-------------------

Potential areas for future enhancement include:

*   Fixing the sound timing issue
*   Adding multiple difficulty levels
*   Implementing a high score system
*   Enhancing visual effects and animations
